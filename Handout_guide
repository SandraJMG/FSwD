Handouts & further reading
This is a guide to all the handouts for this course, all stored under the link 
 https://github.com/Stonepeople/FSiD. Within this Github repository will find the ReadMe file which contains instructions and links to material for each module of the Finding Stories in Data course:
If you prefer, you can read the guide below which explains what to read, and links to the relevant documents: 
There are thousands of guides online which can help you learn more about datajournalism in general as well as specific skills and tools when you need them. You can find a lot of them yourself with a google search – either a general question such as 
How do I do xyz in Excel
Or a targeted google search like the ones we did in the 2nd module: 
Site:edu filetype:ppt “Data Driven Journalism”
would find you powerpoints about Data Driven Journalism used in US universities. (you can just click here to see the results without typing the code)

General Introductions
A lot of people have used the Datajournalism Handbook which was crowdsourced by many experienced datajournalists and contains many interesting examples. 
Paul Bradshaw at Birmingham City University writes the Online Journalism Blog which is always interesting and instructive. Paul is a prolific writer of books about online and data journalism, including The Datajournalism Heist, Scraping for Journalists and Finding Stories with Spreadsheets. I’d recommend all of them if you have the urge to learn more. 

If you need a quick visual guide to using Excel or Googlesheets we have made short videos (around 3 minutes each) for each program: 
General Intro – Excel
General Intro – Googlesheets
Arithmetic and basic functions – Excel
