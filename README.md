Files accompanying [CIJ course](https://tcij.org/scheduled-training) - Finding Stories in Data

The files accompany the 4 modules of the course as follows

**Module 1**

-   You will need [this file](https://github.com/Stonepeople/FSiD/blob/main/donations2019_2020_Exercise.xlsx) which
    contains exercises around skills taught in session 1.

-   [This](https://github.com/Stonepeople/FSiD/blob/main/Interviewing_data.pdf) is the short presentation

-   A [generic introduction](https://github.com/Stonepeople/FSiD/blob/main/IntrotoDataHandout.pdf)

-   If you just want to read about pivot table [this
    pdf](https://github.com/Stonepeople/FSiD/blob/main/PIVOT%20TABLES.pdf) is all you need

-   [Spreadsheets for
    journalists](https://github.com/Stonepeople/FSiD/blob/main/SPREADSHEETS%20FOR%20JOURNALISTS%20HANDOUT.pdf) is the
    handout I wrote for a one-day course covering everything we now do
    in 4 sessions of Finding Stories in Data

**Module 2**

-   This is the [presentation](https://github.com/Stonepeople/FSiD/blob/main/FindingData.pdf) on Finding Data used in module 2

-   [Follow the Money](https://github.com/Stonepeople/FSiD/blob/main/FollowTheMoney.pdf) is a set of links to help get you started if you're interested in financial stories

-   If you want to see the full list of advanced operators the [Cheatsheet](https://github.com/Stonepeople/FSiD/blob/main/GoogleguideCheatSheet.pdf) is downloaded from googleguide.com

- Finally a set of generally [useful links](https://github.com/Stonepeople/FSiD/blob/main/USEFUL%20LINKS%20TO%20DATA.pdf) to get you started

**Module 3**

-   Before you get to module 3 itself, we recommend you watch at least the first four videos in [this doc](https://github.com/Stonepeople/FSiD/blob/main/Module3_videos_guide_v2.pdf)

-   Although Open Refine contains links to useful instructional videos, [this pdf](https://github.com/Stonepeople/FSiD/blob/main/OPEN%20REFINE%20STARTER%20NOTES_JS.pdf) is intended as a useful written guide

-   Reconciling lists using OpenRefine is covered in [this pdf](https://github.com/Stonepeople/FSiD/blob/main/Reconciling%20in%20OpenRefine.pdf)

-   [Scraping the web](https://github.com/Stonepeople/FSiD/blob/main/scraping%20the%20web.pdf) is an excellent tipsheet from [IRE](https://www.ire.org/) (it's well worth joining IRE. at around $70 a year it's worth it for their library of tipsheets alone!)

**Module 4**

-   [Why visualise](https://github.com/Stonepeople/FSiD/blob/main/Why%20visualise%20CIJ.pdf) is the presentation used in module 4. 
-   There's a quick introduction to making graphics from spreadsheets in two parts [Part 1](https://youtu.be/CPG3tj2vZYg) takes you raw data to a graph. [PArt 2](https://youtu.be/n3cFrf4pQsc) takes a look at creating a graph from a pivit table. 
-   [This video](https://youtu.be/Qv-g9XhpOf0) looks at how to do the same thing with Googlesheets
-   There's a more detailed step-by-step guide to making a visualisation from an Excel pivot table [here](https://youtu.be/Pakq8_hauwI) and from googlesheets [here](https://youtu.be/q4TxXLBpxa8)
-   [This video](https://youtu.be/Fw0YXqenFoo) looks at choosing the kind of chart most appropriate to the needs of your story.
